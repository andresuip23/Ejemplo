Wait right here, I'll be back in the morning
I know that I'm not that important to you but to me girl, you're so much more than gorgeous
So much more than perfect
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time I can work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losing your patience and girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waiting for me
Look at my face, when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hating on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter of fact, I ain't never ask no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over, Lil Peep
Nobody flexing as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Making my money and smoking my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it coming, I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone the family want me to be
If I find a way, will you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talking to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone making my beats, you helping me preach
This music is the only thing keeping the peace when I'm falling to pieces

Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm falling to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
